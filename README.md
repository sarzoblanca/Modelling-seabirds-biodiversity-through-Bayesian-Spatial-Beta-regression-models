# Modelling-seabirds-biodiversity-through-Bayesian-Spatial-Beta-regression-models

R code for the paper "Modelling seabirds biodiversity through Bayesian Spatial Beta regression models: A proxy to inform marine protected areas 
in the Mediterranean Sea", by Sarzo, B., Martinez-Minaya, J., Grazia Penino, M., Conesa, D., and Coll, M. XXX 2022.

- Seabirds.RData: The work database.
- The Spatial Beta regression models can be run with the R code called Models
- The overlap between the posterior predictive mean and Mediterranean MPAs and marine IBAs can be calculated using the R code "overlap"
- Some code for plots is also included
- Shape MPAs: shapefiles to read within the Rcode
- Mediterranean IBAs: shapefiles to read within the Rcode
